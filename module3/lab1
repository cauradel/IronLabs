A team of researchers say they have used machine-learning to recreate images in our brains, from pictures subjects were looking at to things they remember seeing.

The research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, was conducted by scientists from Kyoto University in Japan and led by Yukiyasu Kamitani. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the team said they were able to reconstruct images seen by our brains.

In their paper, available on bioRxiv, a number of images were presented that were recreated by the artificial intelligence, known as a deep neural network (DNN). Each image was recreated pixel by pixel by the DNN, generating images that resembled the initial image.

“The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images,” the team wrote in their paper.

The research builds on earlier work by the same team that found that brain activity patterns could be decoded into signal patterns. Other researchers have reported similar work in this field.

“This is a significant improvement on their earlier work,” Professor Geraint Rees, a neuroimaging expert from University College London, told The Times.
